 Chennai Public School likes to tap all possible opportunities to give
 its students a variety in its curriculum. 
 Cambridge English offered by the University of Cambridge, UK is one such opportunity designed to 
 promote English amongst speakers of 
 other languages. It is mandatory for all Chennai Public School students to take up 
 the Cambridge English courses according to their age groups. </font> 
 </p> 
 <p><font face="sans-serif" color="257e98">A good knowledge of English, backed up 
 by the right English language qualification, can give individuals a head start in life, leading to exciting
 study, work and life opportunities at home and abroad.

Cambridge English exams are officially accepted by thousands of universities, employers and governments 
globally which will open doors for students to study or work abroad in the future.
